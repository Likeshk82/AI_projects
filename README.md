Abstract:
Human activity recognition (HAR) plays a crucial role in various fields, including healthcare, surveillance, and human-computer interaction.This study explores the application of deep learning techniques for accurate and efficient human activity recognition. Leveraging the capabilities of deep neural networks, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the proposed approach aims to capture both spatial and temporal features from sensor data.The dataset utilized in this research comprises multi-modal sensor inputs, such as accelerometer and gyroscope readings, collected from wearable devices. The deep learning model is designed to automatically learn hierarchical representations of the raw sensor data, enabling robust feature extraction and discrimination between different human activities. Transfer learning is employed to enhance model generalization across diverse activity categories and varying sensor setups.Experimental evaluations are conducted on real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning framework in accurately classifying activities, including walking, running, sitting, and standing. Comparative analyses against traditional machine learning methods underscore the superior performance and adaptability of deep learning in handling complex and dynamic activity patterns.The results showcase the potential of deploying deep learning models in real-time human activity recognition systems, highlighting their scalability and efficiency. The study contributes to the advancement of HAR methodologies, paving the way for the development of more reliable and robust systems in applications such as healthcare monitoring, assisted living, and smart environments.
